Review consistency — across the slice's tasks, and between the diff and the surrounding codebase.

Across the tasks of this slice:
1. Two tasks encoding the same predicate, constant or rule differently.
2. Duplicated helpers that should be one.
3. Divergent naming, error shapes or JSON keys for the same concept.

Against the surrounding code (read the files the diff touches, and their neighbours):
4. Conventions the diff departs from — error wrapping, logging, path handling, comment density and
   placement, test structure.
5. An existing helper or pattern the diff reimplements instead of using.

Anything visible inside one task's diff alone — a plain bug, a task mismatch — belongs to the
correctness or intent lens; your ground is what only reading across tasks and into the repository shows.
