Detect over-engineering this diff introduces or makes worse. Pre-existing complexity the diff does not
touch is out of scope. Complexity the task description explicitly asks for is not a finding.

1. Excessive abstraction — wrappers that add nothing, factories for a single implementation,
   pass-through layers.
2. Premature generalisation — generic machinery for one concrete case, config objects for two options,
   extension points nothing extends.
3. Unnecessary indirection — builder patterns for simple construction, custom types wrapping stdlib
   types without behaviour.
4. Dead fallbacks — legacy paths kept "just in case", dual implementations where one has no callers,
   silent fallbacks that hide failures instead of failing fast.
5. Premature optimisation — caching, pooling or custom structures for loads that do not exist.

Before reporting any "unused", "no callers" or "never triggers" claim, verify the absence with a
project-wide search (Grep across the repository, tests and config included) and cite that search in the
finding's detail.
