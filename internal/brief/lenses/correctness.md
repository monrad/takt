Review the diff for defects that would produce wrong behaviour at runtime.

1. Logic errors — off-by-one, inverted or incomplete conditionals, wrong operators.
2. Edge cases — empty inputs, nil values, boundary conditions, zero and max.
3. Error handling — unchecked errors, silent failures, errors swallowed or mis-wrapped.
4. Resource management — missing cleanup, leaks, files or processes not released.
5. Concurrency — races, deadlocks, unsafe shared state, goroutine leaks.
6. Data integrity — inconsistent state transitions, partial writes, wrong ordering of writes.
7. Security — injection, path traversal, secrets in code or logs, unvalidated input.

Do not review whether the change matches its task — the intent lens covers that. Do not review
architectural simplicity or over-engineering — the simplicity lens covers that. Do not review test
coverage — the tests lens covers that.
